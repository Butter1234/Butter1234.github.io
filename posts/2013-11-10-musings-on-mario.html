<p>Have you heard about the Mario years? What I mean is, the character years. The year is 2013. My friend told me the character year this year is the year of Luigi. I'm pretty sure that is why Nintendo is currently making Super Luigi Bros. U. I'll tell you something else. In Super Mario 64 the camera was kind of bad. I thought &quot;can they at least use the upper pad on the left of the controller?&quot; Well, actually I have the Super Mario 64 ROM on my computer. I got Super Mario 64 DS this year and it was better. They improved the camera controls and they had minigames. My friend also told me there's this video in some Mario game and the guy tried to jump across a platform and there was this invisible block and the guy kept on falling into this bottomless pit so many times. So that's all. Also you can't post anything because I made the website and it's a static website. I'll post other things not only Mario. Anyways, goodbye!</p>
