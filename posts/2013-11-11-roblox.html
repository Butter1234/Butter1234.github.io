<p>Today 11/11/13, I played air physics on Roblox. It is pretty good overall. You get to fly, skydive, and do other things. You should try it. It tells you the altitude you are flying at and how long you have flown. So if you don't have a Roblox account get one. I also played Slender The Eight Pages. Well, acutually it is good and bad. The enviorment is bad. There are only 3 places. There is a bathroom,the woods, and some other place. It's kind of scary because all of a sudden Slenderman is right behind you. When you die Slenderman appears on the screen. It is good because the screen has a telescope kind of view so it makes the experience scarier. Good bye for now!</p>
